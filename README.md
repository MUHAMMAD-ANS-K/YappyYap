<h2>Detailed Explanation of Features And My Learning</h2>


<p>You can specify time for each of your message and it will be deleted after the specified amount of time from the chat and also from our database though it might take some seconds as you can see by reviewring the scehduleler.py file in the Backend folder which does the clean up jobs.</p>


<p>On the chat page you can also see an anonymity button that will hide your identity by sending your messages with anonymity "on" option in linkage to a dummy username.</p>


<p>There is option to register as both guests and permanent users although both gets different time sessions that are made short for user's own benefit</p>


<p>You can also read more about the features and constraints on terms page of the site</p>


<p>The website also has an admin dashboard. It is not among the best but it does what is required and of course it is authorized to admins only</p>


<p>This website contains a lot of animations and to be honest a large chunk of my time was taken developing those but I learnt from them and now I can make animations much easier</p>


<h2>Making of site</h2>


<p>I wanted to learn about how to make websites and had quite an idea about how by watching tutorials or developing some daily helping single page sites that helped but they had no interface as I was the only user and to be honest instead of doing effort to make an interface I would prefer using some weird interface or terminal cz its easier, serves my laziness. So I decided that I would make some good website and I thought a hard about ideas and couple came to mind but I chose this as I had previously worked with websockets so I decided lets go for a simple chat application and then I continued to build upon it, even now I m doing it.</p>
<h2>Usage of AI</h2>
<p>AI was used to very least extent and even then when I used it I made sure that I try something different than what AI assumes the solution to be in an effort to make this project as least AI slop as possible.</p>
